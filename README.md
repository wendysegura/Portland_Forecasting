# Portland_Forecasting
This is a Data Science project using a Classification problem
In this respository there is data for each year from 2012-2016
2016 in broken into months after July and only goes up to October
All of the information in the csv files are from National Institute of Justice through a challenge they posted as a crime forecasting challenge

There is a Jupyter Notebook reflecting how the data was analyzed and used to predict also how accurate the model that was created is.
There is also a power point presentation lightly outlining what was done in the Notebook.
